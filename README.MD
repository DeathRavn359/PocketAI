# PocketAI
 
This plugin is an experimental plugin for PocketMine-MP by pmmp that works with addons

You need to download a vanilla addon for 1.2 from minecraft.net

https://meedownloads.blob.core.windows.net/worlds/Vanilla_Behavior_Pack_1.2.0.zip

Then put it into /resource_packs in your server folder

Enable it in the resource pack config by adding

` - Vanilla_Behaviour_Pack_1.2.0.zip`

in the config

Right now you can only spawn some entities like guardians and cows + horses

It is basically just a plugin to load and parse addons and their data YET - will be an AI plugin soon though
